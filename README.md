This study was about how immersive mediums affect user’s state-of-mind.
 - 12 Participants

 - Four Stories
 - Datasets: Motion Captured, EEG(Brainwave), Heart Rate 
 
 
 What is the project about?
     Visualize the testers’ motion data, and bio data 
     
       - participants had the highest levels of open-mindedness - being attracted to a topic, but not alarmed -
         on the room-scale VR setting, while the cardboard elicited the highest level of stimulation, which is 
         associated with individuals being more attentive than they are relaxed.
